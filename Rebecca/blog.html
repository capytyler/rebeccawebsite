                <div class="date">2023-05-17</div>
                <p>Love is all we got. But what’s love to me though. 

                </br></br>
               Perhaps it’s started in a strangest way. Right after having fights with my boyfriend but still sending a rabbit sticker to show that I care, still standing up for my family though we always argue over who can use the bathroom first, calling my friends a silly name but sill always seek the best way to help them.
              </br></br>
                 Love goes beyond words, as words can be both powerful but at the same time weightless. Love is all about the little things that surround our lives.
            </br></br>
                  I don't really know a lot about love. But you don’t have say I love you to say I love you. 
          </br></br>
                  For me, love is about seeing something special in myself and enjoying my own company. It's about finding the ridiculous ideas in my head endearing and doing the craziest things with me. Love is about listening to my clearly-you’re-overthinking thoughts at 3 am, laughing at my bad jokes, and cooking for me. Love is about always be there by my side and always support what I do and simply appreciate my existence. 
                </br></br>
                  Love is not just about having someone by your side. It's about the idea that a loved one plants in your head, reminding you that you’re worth it and that you have something special to offer. It's the feeling that sparkles up your loneliest and darkest nights, giving hope for the future.
                </br></br>
                  Even though sometimes the people and things we love fade and are no longer in our lives, the feelings they gave us will remain forever. They haunt you in a good way and they have become ghosts to you and yet it's a way to keep them alive forever. 
                </br></br>
                  Running through an airport to chase the love of your life may seem romantic, but it's also tiring and probably pointless. However, I would still run through an airport for love.
